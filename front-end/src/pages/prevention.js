				The relationship between global warming and forest fire frequency is a
				positive feedback loop. The higher the temperature, the more likely it
				is for a fire to occur, and when more fires occur, more greenhouse gases
				are emitted into the atmosphere, which causes higher temperatures. Thus,
				efforts to mitigate climate change will also help to reduce the risk of
				forest fires.{" "}
